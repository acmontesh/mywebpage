<h3 class="blog-subtitle">What is Feature Selection?</h3>
<div class="blog-paragraph"><p>
Feature selection is necessary in a great proportion of real 
life machine learning applications, drilling among them. One 
approach to such problem is achieved with Shapley values (adapted from game theory, 
to calculate marginal contributions of each feature in the predictions), but it has a
 big flaw: It requires to assume a model. Wolpert posed in 1996 the No-Free lunch set
  of theorems, where is stated that there is no reason to select one model over any 
  other one before experimentation is carried out. This means that doing feature 
  selection with only one model would lead to an incorrect estimation of feature 
  importance (e.g., from a highly biased model) or worse: A loss of important 
  information, if deletion follows the ranking. </p>

<h3 class="blog-subtitle">How can we solve this?</h3>
<div class="blog-paragraph"><p>
<p>
To tackle this problem, we propose an ensemble of models instead of only 
one to calculate the Global Shapley values. As we will see at the end of
 this workflow, the feature ranking resulting from the ensemble differs 
 from the individual rankings extensively.

<h3 class="blog-subtitle"> Final Recommendations </h3>
<div class="blog-paragraph"><p>
<p>
The recommendation from this result, is to use 
ensemble global Shapley values instead of committing 
to a model when ranking the features that will be used 
to perform inference, specially if dimensionality reduction
 from feature deletion follows the feature ranking, with this,
  the risk of having an incorrect ranking, or even loss of important
   information is reduced significantly, as there is no need to 
   make a strong assumption about the model before actually building it. </p>
